Shinobi will contain a series of features that will help testers collect information about a target by using non-intrusive techniques (i.e., subdomain enumeration, google dorking, OSINT, dark web search etc.). Once the information has been collated together, the tool will proceed to assess the targetâ€™s weaknesses by providing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) numbers from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (i.e., identifying vulnerabilities and possible attack vectors).
