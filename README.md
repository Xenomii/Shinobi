# Shinobi

Shinobi will contain a series of features that will help testers collect information about a target by using passive techniques (i.e., subdomain enumeration, google dorking, OSINT, dark web search etc.). Once the information has been collated together, the tool will proceed to assess the targetâ€™s weaknesses by providing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) numbers from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (i.e., identifying vulnerabilities and possible attack vectors).

# Features

Shinobi will focus on acheiving the following features: 
1. Automatically identify domains and subdomains of the target web application
2. Identify open ports & running services of each domain/subdomain
3. Report potential CVEs affecting the running services identified
4. Search for information/data leakage in the Dark Web using APIs
